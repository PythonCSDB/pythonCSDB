Structured Notes
import numpy as np
A structured note has interest or maturity payments that are not fixed in dollars, but perhaps are contingent on some other price or event

Often the payouts are linked to stock prices, interest rates, commodities

But they could be linked to earthquakes, weather

They may have some optionality built into them

Zero Coupon Bonds and Coupon Bonds
P(0,T) is the price today for $1 to be received at date T

B0=∑i=1NciP(0,ti)
Equity Linked Bonds
Consider a bond that pays out one share of ABC stock at date T.
This “bond” has an uncertain payout at date T
Questions
What does it mean for this bond to sell at par?
If there are coupon payment, should the coupons be paid in cash or in shares of ABC?
For regulatory and tax purposes, is this instrument a stock or a bond?
What is the fair price of this bond?
Prepaid Forward Contracts
You pay today to receive the underlying at date T

The prepaid forward price is FP.

FP=FT(0)e−rT
So the fair price of an equity linked bond that pays 1 share of a non dividend paying stock at time T is
FP=FT(0)e−rT=S0erTe−rT=S0
Zero Coupon Equity Linked Bonds
For a stock that pays dividend, d1 at t1, the fair value is:
FP=FT(0)e−rT=(S(0)erT−d1er(T−t1))e−rT
FP=S0−PV(dividend)
# Example of a two year equity linked zero coupon bond
​
​
​
# Let B be the price of this bond. The stock pats 5 dollars  in 6 months and nothing thereafter.
​
S = 100; r = 0.06; T = 2; d1 = 5; t1 = 0.5 
​
B = S - d1*np.exp(-r*t1)
print('The value of this structured note is', round(B,2))
Cash Coupon Linked Bond
#Find the value of a bond that pays coupons every six months for two years and then pays one unit of the stock

B0=cA(0,4)+FP
Here A(0, 4) is the sum of four discount factors.

# The coupon per period is $\$2$; # The stock pays a dividend in each period of $\$1$
# stock is trading at 100. The yield curve ( in 6 month periods) is given below  in continuous compounded form
​
s = 100; c = 2; d = 1
​
yields = np.zeros(5)
yields[0] = 0
yields[1] = 0.05
yields[2] = 0.055
yields[3] = 0.06
yields[4] = 0.064
​
​
# Find the value of the annuity:
annuity = 0
for i in range(1, 5):
    annuity = c*np.exp(-yields[i]*i/2) + annuity
    
# Find the prepaid forward price.
​
​
PVd = 0
for i in range(1, 5):
    PVd = d*np.exp(-yields[i]*i/2) + PVd
Fp = s - PVd
​
B = annuity + Fp
​
print('The value of the structured note is', round(B, 2))
​

If we wanted to price an equity linked note at par, what coupon would we give?

Assume there are n coupon payments with the last one being at time T.

B=cA(0,n)=cA(0,n)−Fp
We want B=S0
c=(S0−Fp)A(0,n)
##Example
s = 100; d = 1 #each year
​
yields = np.zeros(5)
yields[0] = 0
yields[1] = 0.05
yields[2] = 0.055
yields[3] = 0.06
yields[4] = 0.064
​
d = np.zeros(5)
d[2] = 1; d[4]= 1
# Find the value of the annuity with coupon one.
annuity = 0
for i in range(1, 5):
    annuity = np.exp(-yields[i]*i/2) + annuity
    
# Find the prepaid forward price.
​
​
PVd = 0
for i in range(1, 5):
    PVd = d[i]*np.exp(-yields[i]*i/2) + PVd
Fp = s - PVd
​
c = (s-Fp)/annuity
​
print('The value of the coupon that makes the bond price par is', round(c, 3))

Interest is Paid in fractions of stock
Let the number of fractional shares received be c
At maturity get 1 share
Assume there are n periods.
What is the value of this bond
The value of c shares obtained at the jth coupon date, Tj is cFPTj(0)
So:
V0=∑j=1ncFPTj(0)+FPTn(0)
#The price of a stock is 100. 
#The contract gives you 0.5 shares every 6 months for one year and then one additional stock in year 1. 
#The stock pays no dividend and interest rates are 5% continuously compounded. 
#What is the value of this equity linked bond?
​
c = 0.5; dt = 0.5; n = 2; r = 0.05; s = 100
​
c = np.zeros(3); Fp = np.zeros(3)
c[1] = 0.5; c[2] = 1.5
Fp[1] = 100; Fp[2] = 100; 
V = c[1]*Fp[1] + c[2]*Fp[2]
print( 'The value of the equity linked bond is', round(V, 2))
​
#The price of a stock is 100. 
#The contract gives you 0.5 shares every 6 months for one year and then one additional stock in year 1. 
#The stock pays a two dollar  dividend every six months and interest rates are 5% continuously compounded. 
#What is the value of this equity linked bond?
​
c = 0.5; dt = 0.5; n = 2; r = 0.05; s = 100
​
c = np.zeros(3); Fp = np.zeros(3); d = np.zeros(3)
c[1] = 0.5; c[2] = 1.5
d[1] = 2; d[2]= 2
Fp[1] = s - d[1]*np.exp(-r*0.5); Fp[2] = s - d[1]*np.exp(-r*0.5) - d[2]*np.exp(-r*1); 
V = c[1]*Fp[1] + c[2]*Fp[2]
print( 'The value of the equity linked bond is', round(V, 2))

What fractional shares must be paid for the note to be priced at par

We have:
c∗=(S0−FPTN)∑Ni=1FPTj
A stock pays a dividend yield of 2% continuously. The riskless rate is 10% continuously compounded. A The number of fractional shares is c every six months , for one year. Then 1 share is paid out. What should c be for the bond to be priced at par?

Let F1 be the forward price for six months and F2 be the forward price for one year
We have q= 0.02; t1=0.5; t2=1.0; r = 0.10
F1=S0e(r−q)t1 and F2=S0e(r−q)t2. From this we have

Fp1=F1e−rt1=S0e−qt1 and Fp2=F1e−rt2=S0e−qt2
We require S0=(Fp1+Fp2)c+Fp2. Therefore:

S0=(S0e−qt1+S0e−q∗t2)∗c+S0e−qt2
From which we have

c=1−e−q∗t2e−qt1+e−qt2
 q = 0.02; t1 = 0.5; t2 = 1
    
c = (1 - np.exp(-q*t2))/(np.exp(-q*t1) + np.exp(-q*t2))
print( 'The fractional share is', round(c, 5))
Zero Coupon Commodity Linked Bonds
A note pays one unit of commodity at T

What is the price of this note?

It is theprepaid forward price of the commodity
FP=S0e(r−q)Te−rT=S0e−qT
The spot price for gold is S(0) = 400.
The 3 year forward price is F=455.
The riskless rate is 6.25% continuously compounded.
What is the price of zero coupon note paying one ounce of gold in 3 years.
Solution
The forward price is given as 455.
we just discount this at the riskless rate to get $377.2, which is less than the spot price.
Currency Linked Bonds
foreign curreny is paid out instead of domestic currency.
s0 is the spot exchange rate.
BF is the foreign bond price.
Clearly:
BD=s0BF
